CardQuizzler
CardQuizzler is an innovative language-learning application
designed to make learning new languages more interactive and effective.
With CardQuizzler, users can create customized study modules filled with flashcards tailored to their learning needs.
The app offers a dynamic approach to studying by allowing,
organize modules in folders, and control access to their study materials.

Features
1. Create and Customize Modules
   Module Creation: Users can create personalized study modules, each filled with flashcards.
   Two-Sided Flashcards: Each flashcard has two sides, allowing users to input a word, phrase, or sentence on one side and its translation or explanation on the other. Users have complete flexibility in defining the content of their cards.
2. Interactive Learning Experience
   Swipe to Learn: Engage in interactive learning sessions by swiping through your flashcards.
   Swipe Right: Marks the card as studied, indicating you've mastered the content.
   Swipe Left: Marks the card as not yet mastered, indicating you need more practice.
   Difficulty Tracking:
   If a card is swiped left five times consecutively, it gets marked as difficult. These cards are automatically moved to the Difficult Modules section for focused practice.
   Cards marked as difficult need to be swiped right five times in a row to be unmarked as difficult, moving them back to the regular study flow.
3. Module Organization
   Folders: Group related modules into folders for better organization and quicker access. This feature is ideal for users who want to categorize their learning by topics, languages, or difficulty levels.
4. Flexible Access Control
   Only Me: The module is private, and no other users can interact with it.
   Password-Protected: Share your modules with others by setting a password. Users with the password can either study the module or create a copy for their use.
   Open Access: Make your modules available to the entire CardQuizzler community, allowing anyone to study or copy them.
